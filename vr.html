          This is a VR project designed to be an interactive hub space that embodies the spirit of the Univerisity of British Columbia (UBC). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Our aim was to create a welcoming immersive space of UBC for UBC members and non-members to experience. 
          This project incorporated historical and iconic landmarks and elements of UBC. 
          We've also included an interactive paintball feature based on UBC's Grand Snowball Fights and the paint-war of the Engineering Cairm.   
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was a collaborative effort led by students from different faculties and majors at UBC. 
          I was the lead 3D designer and co-developer for the project. My work involved designing and creating the models (landmarks, assets, character) and worked on the paint-ball feature.

          We wanted to create this space to be where you can experience 'UBC and more'. 
          Therefore, we designed it as a fantasy or dream-like environment, almost if you had a dreamed of UBC. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This layout was the initial plan with a circular layout and a spawn point that is led with a pathway towards the central point. 
          We included floating islands in the sky to create this dream-like environment, and combinations of historical landmarks and well-known parts of the campus UBC joined in a single space.

          I worked on creating many of the iconic landmarks and assets of UBC that is arranged around the VR space to replicate the UBC campus. 
          This included the basic assets such as UBC's benches, waste-bins, light poles and the historical and iconic landmarks of the Martha Piper Plaze (waterfountain), UBC sign, totem poles, and clock tower.

          I also created the main player character that is also used as NPC. To represent the UBC mascot: ThunderBird, we wanted to reimagine the user as the mascot of the Univerisity.
          The character was designed to provide a friendly-image character while maintaining the mascot's identity.
          I worked on the design, rigging, to the code implementation for player movement and walking animations.

            The code implementation for player movements were based on Dinesh Punni and Valem Tutorials.

          The paintball feature allows the user to grab a paintball and use it to paint the environment.

          We included a scorekeeping function to allow various users to earn score points for every paintball that landed on the UBC sign.  
          To represent the UBC faculties, we've layed out various paintballs in accordance to the faculties colours theme. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I participated in the development of this paintball feature by implementing the paintability to the environment and the UBC sign. Furthermore, implemented
          the coding logic for the paintball functionality to interact with the environment.

            This paint effect stemmed from on the creators of Mix and Jam, and TNTCProjects that recreated the Splatoon effect.
